## 1. Introduction

This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of the workflow, engine, and key components of the research automation system. The system is designed to automate the research process across multiple platforms, generate actionable insights, and provide a user-friendly API for integration.

---

## 2. Workflow Overview

The workflow of the research automation system can be divided into the following stages:

1. **Input Reception**: Receive domain, project, and description from the user.
2. **Query Generation**: Generate search queries for different platforms.
3. **Data Collection**: Use Google Search API to fetch URLs and scrape content.
4. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the collected data using AI and NLP techniques.
5. **Insight Extraction**: Extract effective triggers, competitors, word cloud data, and pain points.
6. **Refinement**: Refine the analysis using DataStax.
7. **Output Generation**: Return the results in a structured format.

## 3. Engine Explanation

The engine of the research automation system is powered by the following key components:

- **LangChain Groq**: For generating search queries and performing NLP-based analysis.
- **Google Search API**: For fetching URLs from Google Search.
- **WebScraper**: For scraping content from general web pages, Reddit, Quora, and blogs.
- **DataStax**: For refining the initial analysis.

### Key Features of the Engine

- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent web scraping.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Leverages LangChain Groq for generating insights.
- **Dynamic Query Generation**: Creates tailored search queries based on the input domain, project, and description.
- **Refinement Capability**: Sends the initial analysis to DataStax for further refinement.

## 4. Detailed Workflow Breakdown

### 4.1 Input Reception

- **User Input**: The user provides the domain, project, and description via the API.
- **Validation**: The input is validated to ensure it meets the required format.

### 4.2 Query Generation

- **Prompt Creation**: A prompt is created using the provided domain, project, and description.
- **Query Generation**: The prompt is sent to LangChain Groq, which generates search queries for different platforms (general web, Reddit, Quora, blogs).

### 4.3 Data Collection

- **Google Search API**: The generated queries are used to fetch URLs from Google Search.
- **URL Filtering**: URLs are filtered based on the platform (e.g., Reddit, Quora, blogs).
- **Web Scraping**: The WebScraper class scrapes content from the filtered URLs.

### 4.4 Data Analysis

- **Content Extraction**: The main content is extracted from the scraped web pages.
- **Initial Analysis**: The extracted content is analyzed using LangChain Groq to generate initial insights.

### 4.5 Insight Extraction

- **Effective Triggers**: Top 5 effective triggers with weightage are extracted.
- **Competitors**: Top 5 competitors are identified.
- **Word Cloud Data**: Top 20 keywords for a word cloud are extracted.
- **Pain Points**: Top 10 user pain points are identified.

### 4.6 Refinement

- **DataStax Integration**: The initial analysis is sent to DataStax for refinement.
- **Refined Analysis**: The refined analysis is returned and included in the final results.

### 4.7 Output Generation

- **Structured Output**: The results are structured into a JSON format.
- **Resource Links**: Links to the resources used in the analysis are included.
- **Timestamp**: A timestamp is added to the results.
